# Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Core Components

- [app/frontend/src/App.tsx](mdc:app/frontend/src/App.tsx) - Main application component handling UI state and WebSocket connections
- [app/frontend/src/RagSelector.tsx](mdc:app/frontend/src/RagSelector.tsx) - Component for selecting RAG provider type and uploading documents
- [app/frontend/src/FileUploadItem.tsx](mdc:app/frontend/src/FileUploadItem.tsx) - Component for individual file upload items

## Types and Utilities

- [app/frontend/src/types.ts](mdc:app/frontend/src/types.ts) - TypeScript type definitions
- [app/frontend/src/lib/](mdc:app/frontend/src/lib) - Utility functions

## Audio Handling

The frontend handles:
- Microphone capture via browser APIs
- Audio streaming to backend through WebSockets
- Playback of audio responses
- Display of text responses with citations

## User Interaction Flow

1. User selects a RAG provider type
2. User uploads documents for knowledge base
3. User clicks "Start conversation" button
4. Voice input is captured and streamed to backend
5. Responses are played as audio and displayed as text
6. RAG results are shown with source citations
