# Development Workflow

## Project Organization

- `.devcontainer/` - Development container configuration
- `app/` - Main application code
  - `backend/` - Python backend code
  - `frontend/` - React frontend code
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `scripts/` - Development and deployment scripts

## Development Environment

The project supports multiple development environments:

1. **GitHub Codespaces** - Fully configured cloud development environment
2. **Dev Containers** - Local VS Code with containers
3. **Local Setup** - Standard local development

## Backend Development

The Python backend uses:
- FastAPI for the web server
- WebSockets for real-time communication
- Azure SDK for integration with Azure services

Changes to the backend code will be reflected after restarting the dev server.

## Frontend Development

The React frontend uses:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for fast development

The frontend development server supports hot module reloading.

## Scripts

- `scripts/start.ps1` / `scripts/start.sh` - Start development servers

## Testing Changes

1. Make changes to code
2. Test locally using the start scripts
3. Deploy to Azure using azd or the deployment scripts
